Omeka Assignment 009

Describe the collection to be placed in Omeka:

The collection that I would like to see in Omeka deals directly with my doctoral dissertation
as well as a journal article that I just received back from peer review from the 'Journal
of Military History' with a revise and resumit.  This collection is the 30 diaries that are
still in existence from Benedict Arnold's invasion of Quebec through the state of Maine in
1775.  For future writing purposes, it would be significant to have this data organized in a
searchable format that has meaningful metadata so that one does not have to keep looking the
information up about the diaries.

What parts of this collection can be represented by Omeka and its current plugins:

Where Dublin Core is the metadata schema for Omeka several of the fields can be used to model
my data in the software. The following is a list of metadata from the DC schema that would be of use:

identifier (to ID the object)
title
description
creator
subject (In case a larger database was created featuring other diaries from other wars or expeditions)
date (period of time covered by the resource)
relation (linking diaries from the same expedition or diaries written by the same author in other fronts)
format (the physical description of the resource)
language (this is useful because some of my resources from other expeditions are in French and German)
type (text would be the primary type of most resources but a more nuanced exhibition would contain maps)
coverage (this would be the named period, or expedition, covered by the resource)

Perusal through the plugins yields these additional modes of modeling my database for these resources:

The COinS Plugin would be useful to put citation metadata into the items in my exhibition
Exhibit builder provides an interesting way to showcase diaries from expeditions

What parts of this collection cannot be represented by Omeka and its current plugins:

With the aim of use for this collection to be organizing diaries for later and current research
several metadata fields are needed which are not included in the base program of Omeka.  These
are the data from my collection that need customization to be included:

Notes (The purpose of this field is special considerations about the journal such as transcribed
        letters written by the author are contained within the text)

Publishing History (a preponderance of the diaries have been published several times)

Archive (Where the original manuscript is held)

Hometown (Where the author hailed from)

Rank (Military Rank of the individual at the time of authorship)

Dates Served (length of military service)

Occupation (What the occupation of the author was at the time)

Image (A picture of the resource)
