My exhibit is a collection of audio tracks that describe historical events.
The purpose of this exhibit is to provide history educators with a resource to incorporate
audio materials into their course lectures.  A wide variety of songs would be included in this
exhibit including both contemporary responses to the historical event such as 'Waltzing Matilda'
written in 1895 by Banjo Paterson to commemorate the military being called in for the Sheep
Shearers' strike in Queensland, Australia or reflectionary such as 'Pride' by U2 which
highlights Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s message of peace and love.

In addition to the information that is already available for tracks and discs using FreeDB data
regarding the historical event must also be present within the records.  This information includes
the historical subject, a subject ID number, a subject name, a subject year, a subject type
(this can be viewed as a genre of historical event) and the geographic location of the subject.
Clearly, subject type would have to be subjected to fairly rigid rules of a controlled vocabulary
to increase the ability for educators to discover materials and to provide consistency among records.
